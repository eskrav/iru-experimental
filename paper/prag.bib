	before a noun phrase, and attempted to guess which previously mentioned
	referent, if any, would be mentioned next. Our results show that
	writers are more likely to refer using a pronoun or proper name rather
	than a full NP when comprehenders have less uncertainty about the
	upcoming referent, and are more likely to use names than pronouns
	when comprehenders all tend to makes guesses to one or a few incorrect
	referents. These effects hold beyond other possible influences on
	the choice of referring expression type. Our results support addressee-oriented
	accounts of referring form choice (e.g. Brennan & Clark, 1996; Arnold,
	2008) and suggest that language is a rational solution to the problem
	of communication: shorter and less informative expressions are favoured
	when less information is sufficient to carry the message (e.g. Jaeger,
	2006; van Son & Pols, 2003).},

I focus on two key observations: first, that sentence exclamations like Wow, John bakes delicious desserts! and exclamatives like What delicious desserts John bakes! express that a particular proposition has violated the speaker's expectations; and second, that exclamatives are semantically restricted in a way that sentence exclamations are not. In my account of these facts, I propose a characterization of illocutionary force of exclamation, a function from propositions to speech acts of exclamation. The difference in meaning between sentence exclamations and exclamatives has consequences for the type of violated expectation. I end with a comparison to some previous approaches and a tentative extension of parts of the analysis to other constructions.},
