# Interpretation of Informationally Redundant Utterances (Data and Analysis)

This repository contains anonymized experimental data from readers' interpretations of informationally redundant utterances, as well as analysis of this data (multilevel linear regression), including a power analysis based on previous pilot data.

The paper based on this data can be found [here](./paper/paper.pdf).

One of the experiments from which the data was collected, including control conditions and non-experimental filler items, can be found [here](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~eskrav/exp/prag_new/exp_exclamation.html) (the other experiments differ only slightly in stimulus design).
